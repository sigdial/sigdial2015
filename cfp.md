The 16th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL 2015) will be located in Prague, Czech Republic. SIGDIAL will be held September 2-4. 

The SIGDIAL venue provides a regular forum for the presentation of cutting edge research in discourse and dialogue to both academic and industry researchers. Continuing with a series of fifteen successful [previous meetings](http://www.sigdial.org/sigdial-meetings), this conference spans the research interest areas of discourse and dialogue. The conference is sponsored by [the SIGdial organization](http://www.sigdial.org/), which serves as the Special Interest Group in discourse and dialogue for both [ACL](http://www.aclweb.org/) and [ISCA](http://www.isca-speech.org/).

##TOPICS OF INTEREST

We welcome formal, corpus-based, system-building or analytical work on discourse and dialogue including but not restricted to the following themes and topics:

* Discourse Processing and Dialogue Systems

**As with previous SIGDIAL meetings, we will be accepting proposals for special sessions, which will undergo regular SIGDIAL review process.**

##MENTORING SERVICE

For several years, the SIGDIAL conference has offered a mentoring service. Submissions with innovative core ideas that may need language (English) or organizational assistance will be flagged for "mentoring" and conditionally accepted with recommendation to revise with a mentor. An experienced mentor who has previously published in the SIGDIAL venue will then help the authors of these flagged papers prepare their submissions for publication. Any questions about the mentoring service can be addressed to the mentoring chair Svetlana Stoyanchev at mentoring[at]sigdial.org.

##STUDENT SUPPORT

SIGDIAL also offers a limited number of scholarships for students presenting a paper accepted to the conference. Application materials will be posted at the conference website.

##BEST PAPER AWARDS

In order to recognize significant advancements in dialogue and discourse science and technology, SIGDIAL will recognize two best paper awards. A selection committee consisting of prominent researchers in the fields of interest will select the recipients of the awards.

##SPONSOR THE CONFERENCE

SIGDIAL offers a number of opportunities for sponsors. For more information, email the sponsorships chair Kristy Boyer at sponsor-chair[at]sigdial.org.
