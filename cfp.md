All long, short, and demonstration submissions should follow the two-column ACL
2015 format. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft
Word style files tailored for the ACL 2015 conference. Submissions must conform
to the official [ACL 2015 style guidelines](http://acl2015.org/call_for_papers.html), and they must be electronic in PDF.

As in most previous years, submissions will not be anonymous. Papers may include authors' names and affiliations, and self-references are allowed.

##MENTORING SERVICE

For several years, the SIGDIAL conference has offered a mentoring service. Submissions with innovative core ideas that may need language (English) or organizational assistance will be flagged for "mentoring" and conditionally accepted with recommendation to revise with a mentor. An experienced mentor who has previously published in the SIGDIAL venue will then help the authors of these flagged papers prepare their submissions for publication. Any questions about the mentoring service can be addressed to the mentoring chair Svetlana Stoyanchev at mentoring[at]sigdial.org.

##STUDENT SUPPORT

SIGDIAL also offers a limited number of scholarships for students presenting a paper accepted to the conference. Application materials will be posted at the conference website.

##BEST PAPER AWARDS

In order to recognize significant advancements in dialogue and discourse science and technology, SIGDIAL will recognize two best paper awards. A selection committee consisting of prominent researchers in the fields of interest will select the recipients of the awards.

##SPONSOR THE CONFERENCE

SIGDIAL offers a number of opportunities for sponsors. For more information, email the sponsorships chair Kristy Boyer at sponsor-chair[at]sigdial.org.
