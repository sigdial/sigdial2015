# Registration

You register for SigDial through the Interspeech registration website, which means that you can register for both Interspeech and SigDial at the same time, if you wish. Note that if you do not want to register for Interspeech, just check "I won't attend the main conference". 

[Link to the online registration form](https://register-tubs.de/interspeech)

Please note that attending only SigDial and not Interspeech leads to credit card as the only acceptable payment method.
