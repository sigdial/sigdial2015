# Registration

You register for SigDial through the Interspeech registration website, which means that you can register for both Interspeech and SigDial at the same time, if you wish. Note that if you do not want to register for Interspeech, just check "I won't attend the main conference". 

[Link to the online registration form](https://register-tubs.de/interspeech)

Please note that attending only SigDial and not Interspeech leads to credit card as the only acceptable payment method.


## Registration fees 

|----------|-------------------------|-------|
| Category | Early (up to July 20)  | Late (up to September 2) |
| Regular  | EUR 190                   | EUR 235 |
| Student  | EUR 130                   | EUR 155 |

After September 2, you can register on-site. Note that this incurs a
registration fee in Czech Crowns (CZK) instead of Euro (EUR). See the
[local information page](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/events/sigdial-2015)
for details.


## Troubleshooting 

If you run into any problems regarding your registration, please
contact the conference secretariat directly at
kongresse[at]tubs.de, as the SIGdial organizers themselves do not have
access to the registration system.
