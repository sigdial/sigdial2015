###The Interplay of Discussion, Cognition and Instruction in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Environments

####Abstract

Educational discourse is an important area for impact, which is especially timely given recent attention given to online education.  In this talk I will first present a theoretical account of the complex interplay between written or oral discourse, individual cognitive processes, and external guidance in Computer-Supportec Collaborative Learning (CSCL) environments. Based on the Script Theory of Guidance I will analyze how cognitive configurations shape discussions, and how participation in discussions may lead to re-configuration of the participating individuals' cognition. Second, I will give an overview of studies demonstrating the instructional value of specific types of discussion contributions, namely transactive contributions. I will finally elaborate on ways in which transactive contributions to discourse can be facilitated through external guidance, and how technologies may play an important role both in research and in instruction.

####Bio

Frank Fischer holds master's and doctoral degrees in Psychology. He was an assistant professor for Applied Cognitive Psychology and Media Psychology at the University of Tubingen and held a professorship for Instructional Psychology at the University of Erfurt. He was an associate professor for Research on Learning and Instruction at the University of Tubingen and at the Knowledge Media Research Center. Since October 2006, he has been a full professor of Educational Science and Educational Psychology at the University of Munich. He served as Dean of Faculty. He is the speaker of the Munich Center of the Learning Sciences, an interdisciplinary collaboration of more than 30 research groups focusing on advancing research on learning "from cortex to community". He was President of the International Society of the Learning Sciences. His research focuses on scaffolding and guidance for collaborative learning, as well as inquiry and simulation-based learning. Central questions are how discussion, cognition, and instruction interact in technology-enhanced learning environments, and how characteristics of the discussion are associated with the advancement of knowledge and skills of collaborative learners. He serves on the editorial board of several scholarly journals, including Learning & Instruction, Journal of the Learning Sciences, and the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative learning. He is an incoming associate editor for the American Educational Research Journal. He has published more than 100 articles and chapters, and co-edited 6 books and special issues of scientific journals.

###Graph-based Approaches for Spoken Language Understanding

####Abstract

Following an upsurge in mobile device usage and improvements in speech
recognition performance, multiple virtual personal assistant systems have
emerged, and have been widely adopted by users. While these assistants
proved to be beneficial, their usage has been limited to certain scenarios
and domains, with underlying language understanding models that have been
finely tuned by the builders.

Simultaneously, there have been several recent advancements in semantic web
knowledge graphs especially used for basic question answering, efforts for
integrating statistical information on these graphs,  graph-based generic
semantic representations and parsers, all providing opportunities for open
domain spoken language understanding.

In this talk, I plan to summarize recent work on these areas, focusing on
their connection, as a promise for wide coverage spoken language
understanding in conversational systems, while at the same time
investigating what is still lacking for natural human-machine interactions
and related challenges.
